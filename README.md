# DF-CAGE
DF-CAGE is a novel machine learning-based method for cancer-druggable gene discovery. The input for the framework is copy number, mRNA, DNA methylation, and other omics data. The output is the classification score vector. DF-CAGE is mainly divided into two components: 1. The multi-granularity scan module is used to obtain latent variables from each type of omics data. 2. The cascaded forest module determines the classification score vector for each sample.
