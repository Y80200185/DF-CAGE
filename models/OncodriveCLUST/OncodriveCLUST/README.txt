-  The results have been calculated using all non-synonimous point mutations and synonimous mutations as background. Mutational consequence type was obtained from maf column 'Variant_Classification'. 
- Mutation data (PUBLIC MC3 MAF file v.0.2.8 ) were retrieved from syn7824274 and filtered according to these 
  guidelines and scripts: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w4r5w25ihgmliy3/AABS5ooiVW_ZsBgdin_tr0uaa?dl=0
- Recommended threshold: qvalue of 0.05
- The INFO column contains:
     PROT_RANGE: protein range where each cluster is identified, being each cluster comma separated.
     CLUSTER_MUT_COUNT: number of mutations inside each of the previous clusters, in the same order.
