OncodriveFML results:

- The results have been calculated considering all the observed mutations in CDS regions.
- Mutation data (PUBLIC MC3 MAF file v.0.2.8 ) were retrieved from syn7824274 and filtered according to these 
  guidelines and scripts: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w4r5w25ihgmliy3/AABS5ooiVW_ZsBgdin_tr0uaa?dl=0
- CDS regions were extracted from Gencode release 19 (https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html). 
  The annotations include all CDS where both the "gene_type" and the "transcript_type" were tagged as 
  "protein_coding".
- Recommended threshold: qvalue of 0.25 or 0.1, depending of the number of samples in the cohort. Only pvalues 
  of genes mutated in at least two samples have been adjusted with BH. 
- The INFO column contains the following attributes: SAMPLES, number of mutated samples; SNV, number of 
  substitutions; INDEL, number of insertions and/or deletions; STRATIFIED_FDR, stratified BH adjusted pvalues, 
  independent BH correction of CGC genes and not-CGC genes.

  driver mutations. Mularoni L, Sabarinathan R, Deu-Pons J, Gonzalez-Perez A, LÃ³pez-Bigas N.
